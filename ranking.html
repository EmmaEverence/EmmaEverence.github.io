			<h1> Emma Everence </h1>
			<h2> Professional Energy Tester</h2>
			<p> As a professional Energy Tester, I have tried almost every single energy drink out there. 
				From coffee to pre-workout, I have drank it all.
				The way that I test and decice which enery drinks are the best is devidedin to 3 catagories.
				The first is Overall Taste. I decide weather the drink is actually drinkable and does not have an asid like afterburn like most do. 
				The second is how much Energy it gives you. Does it actually give your "energy?" How long does it last? How hard do you crash afterward? 
				The third is what kind of stimulan is in the drink. Caffine does not work the same with everyone. The use of other sitmulants like sugar, canamin, or genzing can give the same boost to all of the consumers.
